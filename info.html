              Hi, I am Miraj Shrestha originally from Nepal, after high school
              currently pursuing my higher studies in Finland. Venturesome but
              stability loving soul. Someone who feels comfortable around people
              but is not afraid to be alone either. That’s probably the reason
              why I feel home both with portrait and nature photography.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started photography with my first SLR in 2016 and two years
              later became a part-time entrepreneur. Today I am pursuing a
              Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology—besides photographing,
              I’ve worked in Data Entry companies and led various NGO groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both my work and hobbies have taken me to fascinating places.
              Lately, I’ve been travelling in different sites of Helsinki.
              Beauty and adventure can be found close to home, but sometimes,
              like in Nepal, faraway places feel like home too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through my nature photos, I aim to promote environmental awareness
              and protection. Spending early mornings with wild animals such as
              foxes, bears, and deer is incredibly rewarding. Studying and
              photographing them over several days allows me to capture their
              true essence. I only wish I had more time for that!
